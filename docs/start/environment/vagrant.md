## Download and Install Vagrant

!!! summary
    Vagrant is a virtualization software that allows us to create a virtual machine where to run our bot during its development. It's useful mainly for two reasons: it doesn't messes up your own machine and it allows all of us to work with the "same computer" even thought everyone will run it from its own system.
